        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>I was born and raised in China. My birthday is July<sup>5th</sup>. Coming from a family with <mark><em>open-minded</em></mark> parents, I was always encouraged to explore new things from an early age.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> I chose this <abbr title=" Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> course because of my curiosity in digital world. Since I was a student, I always find a designer is the dream role to be, and I am always dreaming to build my own projects.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>I'm passionate about nature and actively participate in outdoor activities. Meanwhile, I can stay by myself all day just reading or watch films. I believe in sustainable living and mindful consumption, which guides both my personal decisions. My future aspirations include establishing a wildlife photography foundation while continuing to develop my skills in things I could learn in design courses.</p>
